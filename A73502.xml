            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

So great is thys arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and of ſo great weyght and importaunce, that it was thought worthy to kepe our ſaid Sauiour ſtyl on earth after he was ryſen from death to lyfe, to the confirmation therof in the hartes of hys diſciples.

<pb facs="tcp:173610:9"/> it is wrytten, and thus it behoued Chriſt to ſuffer, &amp; to ryſe from death the thyrde daye,<note place="margin">lu. xxiiij</note> and to haue prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched openly in hys name penaunce and remiſſion of ſynnes to all the nations of the worlde. Ye ſee, good chriſten people, howe neceſſarie thys artycle of oure fayth is: ſeynge it was proued of Chriſt hymſelfe by ſuch euident reaſons and tokens by ſo longe tyme &amp; ſpace. Now therfore as our ſauiour was dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for oure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte and inſtruction to teſtifie it, ſo let vs be as ready in oure beleue to receyue it to our comforte and inſtruction. As he dyed not for himſelfe, no more dyd he ryſe agayne for hymſelfe. He was dead, ſayth ſaint Paule, for our ſynnes and roſe agayne for our iuſtification. O mooſt comfortable worde euermore to be borne in remembraunce. He dyed, ſayeth he, to put away ſynne, he roſe agayne to endewe vs wyth ryghtuouſnes.

Yf any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubt of thys victorye:<note place="margin">i. cor. xv</note> let Chriſtes glorious reſurrection declare hym the thynge.

And here truly he dyd ſhew the diuerſitie of bodyes, and what difference there ſhalbe betwene the ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodyes, and betwene the ſpirituall, betwene the materiall and corruptible bodyes in thys worlde, &amp; betwene the ſpirituall bodyes and incorruptible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſurrection. Trouth it is alſo that we ought not to ſuffer any infideles as were the Iues to enter

Nowe Ieſus beynge in the myddes of them dydde ſalute them in gyuynge vnto them hys peace wyth whych gretynge or ſalutation he confor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted and confirmed hys diſciples myndes that they ſhulde nothynge doubt of hys reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whych as the Euangeliſt Luke wytneſſeth they counted but for a dreame.<note place="margin">Luke. xxiiij.</note> Wherfore he ſhewed vnto them hys handes and hys ſyde perced.

To theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples I ſaye he did ones gyue his peace and made them his apoſtles that is to ſaye his legates or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours not onely of Iurye, but of al the worlde, in lyke maner as god the father had ſent him and made hym apoſtle in the worlde. And he gaue them the holy goſt for to remytte ſynnes, and to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his name, and whoſe ſynnes ſo euer they pardoned ſhuld be forgyuen in heauen. The pardone of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles aſſuredly was but a ſigne of the trewe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, which was made on hygh alredye. And vnto them to whome they wolde not remytte here in erthe they ſhulde not be remytted nor pardoned in heuen. And this that they did not pardon them, was ſigne

But who were they whome they dyd not forgyue? Truly all thoſe which dyd not giue feith and credence to their wordes. Nowe in thys apperinge Thomas called Didimus was not preſent. Wherfore when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples dyd ſhewe hym that they had ſene our Lorde ryſyn agayne to life, whyche had ſhewed vnto them bothe his handes and hys ſyde percyd, he anſwered that he wolde not beleue them, onles he myghte ſe him and put his finger in to the holes of the nailes and hys hande into hys ſyde. So eighte dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oure Lorde the dores beynge ſhutte, dyd againe apere in the myddes of them as he had done before and gaue them for gretynge hys peace accordynge to the vſage of the Iues,<note place="margin">Pax vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.</note> by whyche is vnderſtande quietnes of conſcience and all goodnes.

Whiche done, Thomas did confeſſe
<pb facs="tcp:173610:19"/> hym to be his Lorde and his God. And truly not ſo much Thomas as the ſpirite of fayth whiche wyth the fayth entred into hym. At that tyme oure Lorde gaue witneſſe of fayth vnto Thomas whiche hathe beleued in ſeynge of hym, but he dothe gyue farre greater prayſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacion vnto them whiche haue beleued, and yet haue not ſene hym in perſon corporally, but only ſpiritually with the eye of feyth or myſtically in forme of breade in the mooſt bleſſed ſacrament of the aulter, and alſo vnto them whiche ſhall beleue him. Then let vs beleue him, by ſeynge him ſpiritually, and ſo doyng we ſhal be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py then Thomas, in thys that he hath ſene hym cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally.

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN this Goſpel good people our Lord doth ſhew vs, that he is the true and right ſhepherd. And it is good reaſon, for he only hath giuen himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, and hath quyckened all hys ſhepe. He alonly doth nouriſh with his doctrine all his ſhepe with the fode of euerlaſtinge life. Yf the wolfe doth come, that is the greate deuell of hell or any of hys members, he neuer forſaketh his ſhepe but doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende and delyuer them from the force and myghte of the enemye, for he is ſtronge aboue all, &amp; is more myghty then all. And alſo the ſhepe be hys, and he hath bought them with a greate pryce, which is a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue all prices. He doth loue them according to the price, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, more than any thought can thinke or tonge expreſſe. And he hath not alonly boughte them agayne, but he hathe made them and created
<pb facs="tcp:173610:22"/> them ſo that they be his owne workes and his owne ſhepe. He ſurely is the ſhepherde by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al thinges bene made. Wherfore naturally he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not hate them. He is no forgetfull ſhepherde, but he is a ſhepherde knowing all, he can forget nothinge. For as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal father knowith al: ſo in like maner he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth al. As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father eternal knowith al in giuing him al, in like maner he knowith his ſhepe in giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. For he giueth them life, wiſedome &amp; might. Yea and ſuche life, wiſdome, and might, as is aboue the capacitie of the worlde. For thoſe that be accordinge to the worlde be but ſhadowes of them. And by this wiſdom which ſurmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, his ſhepe know him. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good herdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giuing life to al, know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing al &amp; which is almighty. But the hired ſhepherd is none ſuch. He woll not dye for his ſhepe. He doth not giue them life. Yea when the wolfe commeth he doth leue them foraſmoch as they be not his owne. He hath neither made them nor yet bought them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. He therfore rennyth awaye, and letteth them be loſte, and deuoured wyth the wolfe, and fynally go into euerlaſting damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He is vnmighty. He is ignorant &amp; cleane vnlike vnto the good herdma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Furthermore this hired ſhepherd hath but a lytle &amp; a particuler flocke. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good herdma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath a grete flocke, he hath the ſlocke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iſrael &amp; of al other nations. He hath the vniuerſal flocke, whyche from daye to daye he leadethe and gatheryth to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may heare his ſwete voice &amp; hys holy doctrine (whyche is the doctrine of the goſpell) tyll tyme that all the worlde ſhall be but one flocke, and that there be but one herdman, whyche is our Lord
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:173610:22"/> Ieſu Chriſte, as it is ſayde here. And there ſhalbe made one ſhepecote and one herdman. Now by this parable good frendes we be taught and enformed of the true office of Chriſt, and wherfore he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thys worlde. Hys office whervnto he was ſent of hys father was to teach vs and alſo to ſaue vs. As touchynge hys doctrine and teachynge, who euer in fedynge of hys flocke was more vigilant, more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, more paynfull than he was? Who euer miniſtred to hys ſhepe more diligently the fode of the euange<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licall veritie? All that herde hym ſpeake and preach were aſtonnyed vpon hys doctrine. For he taught them not after the faſhion of the ſcribes and phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees whych neuertheles were the greate doctours &amp; learned men of the lawe but as one hauynge a won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfull grace and authoritie.

Neyther dyd Chriſt only teach hys ſhepe, that is to ſaye, thoſe that folowed hym lyke ſhepe that were well nere loſt, but he alſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them beſtowynge euen hys very lyfe for them.

                  <p>THys Epiſtle, good chriſtian brethern &amp; ſyſters is very excellent and notable.

                  <p>Thyrdly Chriſte doth preuent his apoſtles when he eſpyed them not to atteine his wordes and that they wold aſke him the meanyng of the ſame, ſayeng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in thys wiſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly foraſmoche as Chriſte hath tolde hys apoſtles of the ſorowe and heuines &amp; of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſhuld happen vnto them for hys ſake: he nowe agayne doth comforte them declaringe vnto them what ſhall happen after ſuch ſtormes of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Your heuines ſayth he ſhalbe chaunged into ioye, as who ſhulde ſaye the worlde as ſone as they ſhal haue kylled me woll thynke they haue won the

I ſhall comforte you, and in your heuynes pacifie you, &amp; make you gladde. And albeit, after that tyme alſo ye muſt ſtyll ſuffre moch wronge and reproche for my name and for the goſpel ſake: yet your affliction &amp; croſſe ſhall not laſte longe, but eternall ioye ſhall anone enſue &amp; folowe.

                  <p>In ſemblable wiſe ye be nowe ſadde and heuy for my departure, but I ſhal come ſee you agayne, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your hartes ſhal leape for ioye &amp; no man ſhalbe hable with all the diſpleaſure he can do you, to take awaye this your ioye from you. Aſſuredly (my fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des) thys ſimilitude whych is here brought forth of Chriſt, is excedingly comfortable. For fyrſt of all yt ſheweth that perſecution trouble and croſſe muſt as ſurely folowe the confeſſion of the goſpell, as it is ſure that a trauelyng woman cannot brynge forth her chyld without ſorow and grefe, but in the meane ſeaſon the Chriſten man thorough the word of God muſte nedes afterwarde haue greate comforte and ioye. Furthermore this trouble croſſe affliction and perſecution of the true chriſtians ſhall not be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall and euerlaſtinge, but it ſhall endure but for a ſeaſon. And on the contrary parte the worlde ſhall

For the worde is a farre greater thyng, it is euen an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly diuine good and perfecte gyfte whych co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from aboue euen from the father of lyghtnes, wyth whome is no tranſmutation of lyght and of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, neither can he ſuffer that we ſhuld mengle our dreames and darknes with his lyghtſome worde, I meane our owne inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, our blindnes, our careles maners, our carnal lybertie, our euel liefe &amp; ſo forth. We be alſo here admoniſhed and taught of the final vſe of gods worde &amp; wherfore it ſerueth. Yt ſerueth doubtles, that by it we ſhulde be regenerate and be made the fyrſte frutes of the creature of god, whych cometh not of oure owne deſeruynges, but it is the worke of god the father, whych doth renewe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendre vs wythe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of trouth that we maye be the firſt frutes of hys creature.

Euery good and perfyte gyfte is from aboue, that is to ſaye, the worde of god is perfyte, it nedeth none other worde to ſtey it, &amp; to make it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte. Yea thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſt neither take it nor vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de it perfytly, onles it be gyuen the of god. Yt is of it ſelfe moſte perfyte, and it is it alſo whych onlye can make vs perfyte. Yt procedeth frome the father of lyghtes, that is to wytte from god whych is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only cauſe of all lyght in ſuch ſorte that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thynge whych we ſe in vnderſtandynge the worde, is of god. Yt is alſo the gyfte of god that hys worde dothe lyghten, for the father is of hymſelfe lyght. <hi>Wyth whom is no variablenes nor chaunge into darkenes,</hi> that is to ſaye, he can not abyde nor ſuffer that the lyght &amp; darknes ſhuld be confounded or myngled togither. For he is the father of lyght only, and not of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Neither can he ſuffer that we ſhulde glorye and bragge of his worde as of a gyfte and in the meane ſeaſon do the workes of darkenes. And by this the apoſtle ſaynt Iames doth moue vs from euyl wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes by thexemple of god whyche is intranſmutable and inconuertible that is to ſay he is not now light now darkenes. And therfore ought not we to folow both lyght and darknes togither. <hi>For wyllyngly be gatte he vs wyth the worde of his trouth, that we ſhulde be the firſt frutes of his creature.</hi> As though ſaynt Iames wold ſaye. Bicauſe god hath regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs by the word of trouth that we might be now

But here is a doubte, how thys texte ought to be vnderſtande (go into al the world) ſyth the Apoſtles neuer paſſed through out all the worlde.

For where the Goſpel is, there is baptiſme and al that pertayneth to chriſtianitie. And therfore the Lorde ſayeth. He that beleueth not ſhalbe damned. He ſayeth not, he that is not baptiſed. For baptiſme wythout fayth is nothynge worth, but it is lyke to a paper that hathe a ſeale hangynge to it and hath no wrytynge in it.

Furthermore yf thys ſayenge of Chriſt muſt nedes ſtande, few ſhalbe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for very fewe of the ſayntes haue done al theſe. Some therfore to auoyde thys inconuenience do ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounde theſe ſygnes myſtically,<note place="margin">A myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pretaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſayenge that they do ſpeake wyth new tonges whych where as before they taught deuelyſh doctrines, nowe they confeſſe Chriſt and ſo they be new men. By takynge awaye of ſerpentes they vnderſtande the deſtroyenge of pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtiferouſe doctrines, hereſies and ſectes.

Albeit thys interpretation is honeſt and a mater of trouth that ſuch as beleue ſhall worke theſe feates, yet it is not the ryght ſenſe and meanynge of thys text. This than is the meanynge. Where a chriſtian man hath fayth, he ſhall haue power to worke theſe ſygnes and they ſhal folow hym, as Chriſt hymſelfe ſayeth in an other place:<note place="margin">Io. xiiij.</note> Verely verely I ſaye vnto you, he that beleueth in me the workes that I do he ſhal do, yea and he ſhal do greater then they be. For the chriſten man hath the ſame power wyth Chriſte, Chriſt is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munitie, he is ſette in the ſame goodes wyth Chriſt. Furthermore Chriſt gaue them power agaynſt wycked ſpirites to caſt them out &amp; to heale al maner of ſyckeneſſes as it is redde in the tenth of Matheu. Alſo in the .xix. pſalme ye rede: Thou ſhalt walke vpon Lions and Dragons. Wherfore where
<pb facs="tcp:173610:59"/> a chriſten man is, the power to worke theſe ſygnes &amp; myracles is not taken awaye, as by many exemples it hath ben proued. But no man ought to do them, onles it be neceſſarie and the caſe requyre it. For the Apoſtles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues wrought not theſe myracles but only to the teſtification of gods worde that ſo by my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles the Goſpell myght be confirmed, as the texte ſayeth. They went and preached euery where, the Lorde workynge wyth them and confirmynge the worde wyth myracles folowynge. But nowe after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Goſpell is ſpred abrode and opened to the hole world, myracles be not neceſſary as they were in the Apoſtles tyme. It foloweth: <hi>whan the Lorde had ſpoken vnto them, he was receyued into heauen.</hi> That is to ſaye, he went vp to begyn hys ſpirituall and heauenly kyngdome, and drewe wyth hym oure hopes into heuen that thyther, whether we ſawe him aſcende we ſhulde alſo folowe.

And from that daye afterwarde for the ſpace of fyfty dayes they walked in the wyldernes, tyll at laſt they came to the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sinay, where by Moſes the lawe was gyuen them of God. For thys cauſe they kept that ſolempne holydaye whyche we call in Greke Pentecoſt that is to ſaye the fyftye daye and in Englyſh Wytſonday. Now therfore fyfty dayes from Eſter beynge accomplyſhed and the memory of the lawe whych god had promulgate to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the mounte Sinay fulfylled: the holy gooſt came and gaue an other lawe. Nowe therfore, thys day is celebrate of vs not becauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde facte but becauſe of the newe, I meane, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ndyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt. So we declare a certayne difference betwene oure Pentecoſte, and the Iues Pentecoſt. Fyrſte the Iues kept this daye, bycauſe the lawe wrytten was then gyuen vnto them. But we oughte to celebrate oure Pencecoſte bycauſe the lawe of God was then ſpiritually delyuered vnto vs. For the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge hereof,<note place="margin">ij. co. iij and iiij.</note> Saynte Paule is to be broughte forth whiche alſo putteth the ſame difference, wher he ſpeaketh of two maner prechynges. And as there be two maner preachynges, ſo be there two ſortes of people. Firſt was the lawe wryten, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded and compriſed in lettres and therfore it is called the lawe of the lettre, bycauſe it remayneth in lettres and entreth not in the breſt, neyther do any workes folowe it ſaue hypocritical and conſtreyned workes, and therfore the people alſo remayne ſtyll but lyterall and fleſhly. And bycauſe it was compry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:173610:69"/> onlye in lettres and was all togyther in deade wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, it kylled and made a dead people, for the hart was dead bycauſe it dyd not of the owne accorde the commaundement of god. For yf euery man ſhuld be lefte to his owne wyll to do what hym luſteth wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all feare of punyſhement there ſhulde be founde none but wolde rather be fre and louſe from the law then bounde therto. For thus he naturally thinketh. Lo God wyll ſurely punyſhe me, yea and dryue me into hel, onles I kepe his commaundementes. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature feleth it ſelfe vnwyllynge, and to do them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no maner loue or delectation, wherfore man is forth wyth made enemye to god by reaſon of the penaltye when he fealeth hymſelfe a ſynner, and that he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not ryghtly before God, ſo that he wold rather that there were no God. Thys bytternes is infixed in the harte agaynſt God, thoughe nature goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout neuer ſo much to garnyſh her ſelfe wyth fayre workes. It appeareth therfore how that the lawe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pryſed in ſcripture and letters doth iuſtifye noman nor yet can entre into the harte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The law ſpritual.</note>The other lawe is ſpirituall whyche is wrytten not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> penne or ynke, nor is declared wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth after the faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Moſes wrought the mater in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone, but lyke as we ſe in thys ſtory. The ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly gooſt commeth downe from heauen and fylleth them all together, makynge them to haue clouen &amp; fyry tonges and to preache frankely and frely farre otherwyſe then it was done before, ſo that al the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple was aſtonnyed thereat and wondered. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gooſte I ſaye commeth and repleniſheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harte, he chaungeth the man whych loueth God and doth
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:173610:69"/> gladly all that euer is acceptable vnto hym. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al thynges be there lyuely, quycke is the vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtandynge, the eye, the mynde, and the harte, whyche brenneth and is rapte wyth the deſyre of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

Wherfore here is al the crafte ſet to diſcerne and preach ryght<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly of the holy gooſt. Heretofore men haue preached of hym that he bryngeth to paſſe and prompteth all thynges what ſo euer eyther the counſayles decerne or the B. of Rome in hys canonical law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth where as neuertheles al thoſe thynges be only exter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne and outwarde whych he ordeneth or gouerneth.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore thys order of thynges is clene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twharte and prepoſterous, in that they make of the workes of the holy gooſt a lettered and a dead lawe where it ought to be ſpiritual and lyuely, &amp; ſo there is made of it a Moſaicall and humane tradition. The cauſe is that they know not what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gooſt is, wheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to he was gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or what hys feate &amp; office is.

Here thou ſeeſt it is not the offyce of the holy ghooſt to make bokes &amp; to enacte lawes, but that he is ſuche a God that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wryteth the thynge in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kyndleth it, that
<pb facs="tcp:173610:70"/> createth a new mynde, makynge man to reioyſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god and to be rauiſhed with a new loue toward hym, &amp; conſequently w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> glad mynde to do hys dutye and ſeruice to all men franckly. After thys ſort the partes of the holy ghoſt be ryghtly preached, he that paynteth them otherwiſe, beleue him not. For where he commeth thus thou ſeeſt he taketh awaye the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and maketh men fre from ſynne and from the compulſion of the lawe ſo that he raynynge in theyr breſt maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in whome he is reſident to do wyth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out compulſion all that the lawe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth. But thou wylt aſke wherby he bryngeth to paſſe &amp; what thynge he vſeth thus to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and renue the hart? Surely by that he ſheweth and preacheth of Ieſus Chriſt (as Chriſt hymſelfe in the .xv. chap. of Ihon ſayeth) whan the comforter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth whome I ſhall ſende you from my father I meane the ſpirite of trouth whych procedeth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father he ſhal beare wytnes of me. Nowe oftentymes ye haue herde that the goſpel or Euangel is the thynge whych god ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth to be preached in the worlde and to be tolde to euery man that is to wyt that none can be iuſtifyed by the dedes of the lawe but rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a worſe thinge come therby, and therfore he ſente downe hys mooſt deare ſonne to dye and to ſhede hys bloud for vs by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe we of our owne powers coulde not rubbe out the ſpotte of ſynne nor be delyuered from it. But to the preachynge hereof another thynge yet is requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, euen the holy gooſt whome God muſt ſende.

Now therfore whyle the holy gooſt prynteth into the chriſten ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s harte howe he hath God hys mercyfull and graciouſe Lorde, it is a pleaſure for hym for Gods ſake boldly to execute and ſuffre any maner of thynge.

Hytherto I haue declared vnto you, the hyſtorie of

                  <p>Lo good people here ye maye ſe (as I haue often tymes preached vnto you) that the frute of fayth is charitie,<note place="margin">Charite is the frute of fayth.</note> whych thynge can not be denyed.

And furthermore we ſaye agaynſt the wycked Ana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baptiſtes that the baptiſme of children is not vayne but neceſſarye to ſaluacion.

Philip thapoſtle entered into a cytie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maria and preached there to the Samaritanes the glad tydinges of our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſu, how he beynge the ſonne of God came downe for the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of mankynde. Thys his preachynge he dyd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo confirme wyth myracles. For (as the texte alſo de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clareth) the vncleane ſpirites cryenge wyth loude voyce came out of many that were poſſeſſed of them And many take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth palfeis and many that halted were healed. Now the people gaue great hede to the thynges whych Philip ſpake. And aſſone as they gaue credence to Philips preachynge of the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and of the name of Ieſu Chriſte, they were baptiſed both me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and wemen. Here ye ſe (good people) how the Samaritanes whych were Hethen perſons yea and ſuch perſons as the Iues whyche were the peculiar and proper people of god toke for very contempte and vyle perſons, receyued the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt forthwyth at the preachynge of ſaynt Philip and were by and by baptiſed. Thus farforth are the Samaritanes brought. Now the lection red in the church thys day goeth further and ſayth, that
<pb facs="tcp:173610:79"/> when the Apoſtles whyche were gathered togyther at Ieruſalem herde ſay that the Samaritanes had receyued the worde of God, they ſent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Iohn, whiche when they were come downe from the hyghe cytie of Ieruſalem thyther vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they prayed for them, to thintent they myght receiue the holy ghoſte. For as yet the holy ghoſte was not come on none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, onlye they were baptized in the name of Chriſt Ieſu. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> layde theſe two Apoſtles theyr handes vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Samaritans, and anone they receyued the holy ghoſt. This is the hiſtory redde in the church as thys daye. But now my frendes what frute and profyte ſhal we beare away of this leſſon? What is here to be gathered? Nothyng? Yes truly for there is nothynge wrytten,<note place="margin">Ro. xv.</note> ſayeth S. Paule: but it is wryten for our learnynge, that by pacience and confort of ſcriptures we ſhuld haue hope.<note place="margin">☞</note> Fyrſt ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ye ſhall note howe glad the Apoſtles were to heare, that theſe Samaritans were turned to the Goſpell of Chriſte, and they were not only glad, but alſo carefull for them, leſt they myght happen to go backe agayne to theyr olde baguage and blyndnes. And therfore in all haſt they ſent theſe two Apoſtles Peter and Iohn to confirme and ſtrengthen theyr faith. Here we be taught what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of true &amp; good Apoſtles, yea of all good Chriſten men is. For we ought in lykewyſe to be carefull for oure brethren y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they maye be broughte to the perfeyte knowlege of gods worde. And namely ſuche as call them ſelfes Apoſtolicall perſons and Apoſtles fellowes &amp; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours (as the byſhoppes of Rome do) oughte in this behalfe to folow thexe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of thapoſtles charite.
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:173610:79"/> But they do cleane contrary, they rather plucke me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Goſpell, then allure them vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Seconde, ye ſhall note, that before the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſte, when as yet the Iues and Gentyles were not ioyned togyther by all one fayth,<note place="margin">Math. x</note> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels were forbydden to entre into the cyties of the Samaritanes. But after the reſurrection, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were bydden for the ſpredynge abrode of the goſpell to go into all partes of the worlde, then that former commaundemente whiche was but temporall and whyche dyd ſerue but for a tyme, was taken awaye and ceſſed.</p>
                  <p>Thyrdly, in this hiſtorye ye ſhall marke, that the Samaritanes receyued forthwyth the holy ghoſte aſſone as they beleued and were baptized. For aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly true and perfecte baptiſme can not be without the holy ghoſt. Furthermore it is not poſſible that fayth can be in that perſon where the holy ſpirite of God dothe not inhabite, as many places aſwell of ſcripture, as of auncient fathers do wytneſſe. Yea S. Auſtin affirmeth playnly in his boke, <hi>de preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia dei,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auſtine</note> that the holy ghoſt dothe dwell and inhabite in infauntes or childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be baptized. Wherfore how muche more is he reſident and abydynge in perſons of age and diſcretion which haue fayth and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed? So it is no doute, but theſe Samaritanes at the preachyng of S. Philip receiued the holy ghoſt, excepte perchaunce ye woll ſaye, that S. Philippes preachynge had leſſe vertue and efficaciem it, then the preachynges of thother Apoſtles had, whyche in no wyſe is to be graunted. <label type="milestone">

<pb facs="tcp:173610:80"/> the hiſtorye red in the Churche this daye, that after the Samaritanes had receyued the worde of God, the holy Ghoſt as yet was not come on none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore the Apoſtles eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that purpoſe ſent Peter and Iohan, whiche prayed for them that they myght receyue the holy Ghoſte. My frendes, what ſhal we ſay to this? Dyd the Samaritanes receyue goddes worde, dyd they beleue, were they baptiſed, and yet were they voyde of the holy ghoſt? Howe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this be? Chryſte hym ſelfe ſayeth, he that beleueth &amp; is baptyſed ſhall be ſaued.<note place="margin">mar. xvi</note> But onles a man be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with the holy ghoſt, he can not be ſaued, as the ſame Chryſt alſo teſtifyeth in the thyrde Chapter of Iohn. Wherfore it muſt nedes folowe that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritaynes had receyued the holy ghoſt, foraſmuch as true baptiſme can not be without the holy Ghoſt Howe than ſayth S. Luke here that the holy ghoſt was not yet come on the Samarytanes. To this doubte I anſwere in fewe wordes,<note place="margin">The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> that this texte in this place that the holy Ghoſt was not yet come v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, is to be vnderſtande not of the ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſpirite or holy Ghoſte,<note place="margin">☞</note> but of thoſe manifeſt and notable gyftes of the holy Ghoſt. They had the holy Ghoſt to comforte them, and to lede them to al trueth neceſſary to their ſaluacion, but they had him not yet to do miracles and ſpeake ſtraunge tonges as in the primatyue Churche they had for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmacion of Chriſtes doctrine. Neyther is it at this day neceſſarye, the Goſpell being nowe ſtablyſhed, that men ſhuld haue ſuche wonderfull gyftes of the ſpirite.</p>

Certaynly all falſe doctours, all falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, all proude phariſees that woll iuſtifye them ſelues by theyr owne workes and all hypocrites be here wonderfully touched. And why? Bycauſe they entre not into the ſhepefolde by the dore, but clyme vp an other waye. What call ye clymmynge vp an other waye?

He that wol entre into thys congregacion, into this church, into the holy communion and felowſhip of chriſten perſons any other wayes than by Chriſt, he is a thefe and no chriſtian perſon. He that alſo woll teache any other doctrine in Chriſtes churche than ſuch as Chriſt hath taught, is no paſtoure, no byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, no true ſhepeherde, but a thefe rather, a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, a wolfe. And it is much to be feared, leſt there be at thys daye many mo wolues and theues, than be true herdmen &amp; feders.

He woll not playe the crabbe fyſh whych wolde haue taught her doughter to go ſtreyght, but wold not leade her the waye her ſelfe and teach her by her exemple how to go, as it is in Eſopes fables. I am afrayed we haue many crabbes.

                     <p>THere was a man of the Phariſees named Nico<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demus, a ruler of the Iewes. The ſame came to Ieſus by nyght and ſayd vnto hym: Rabbi, we knowe that thou arte a teacher come from God, for no man coulde do ſuch myracles as thou doeſt excepte God were wyth hym. Ieſus anſwered and ſayd vnto hym: Verely, verely, I ſaye vnto the, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be borne from aboue, he can not ſe the kyngdome of God.

Ieſus anſwered: verely verely I ſaye vnto the, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte a man be borne of water and of the ſpirite, he can not enter into the kyngdome of God. That whych is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is borne of the ſpirite is ſpirite. Maruayle not thou that I ſayd to the, ye muſt be borne from aboue. The wynde bloweth where it lyſteth, and thou hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reſt the ſounde therof, but canſt not tell whence it commeth and whether it goeth.

                  <p>IN thys Goſpell (good people) is conteyned a ſore diſputacion vpon the iuſtyce of the ſpirtye, and the iuſtice of the fleſhe.

And yet neuertheles this worldly wyſe and holy man is not ſo hardy nor ſo ſtronge, that he dare openlye come to Chriſte or ſpeake vnto hym, albeit he iudgeth Chriſt a teacher ſente from God, and can not denye hys ſygnes and myracles. I praye you, why doth not reaſon here come forth, openly to confeſſe Chriſtes doctrine? For thys thynge doth Chriſt in any wyſe requyre where he ſayeth.

Surely reaſon can not do thys, it farre paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth her powers to ſubiecte herſelfe to the hatred of the worlde for Chriſtes ſake. And therfore Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth of vs to hate oure owne ſelues, to kyll oure olde Adam,<note place="margin">Math. x</note> that we may ſo be tranſformed into new creatures. But what knowlege hath our fleſh &amp; our nature of ſuch tranſfourmynge or new byrth? Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely no knowlege, no felynge, no vnderſtandynge at al, as thys ſayntly Nicodemus this holy prelate tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtynge to hys owne good workes ful wel declareth. Chriſt talketh of the ſpirituall and new byrth, &amp; Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus loketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the carnal byrth, ſayeng thus. How can a man be borne agayne whan he is olde? Shall he crepe agayne into hys mothers wombe? Herken how foolyſhly, how vnwyſely for al his out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde holynes thys noble prelate ſpeaketh of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thynges? Yea Chriſt is fayne to expounde vnto hym, how it commeth to paſſe that we be made newe creatures. Howbeit he yet vnderſtandeth hym not &amp; therfore he aſketh agayne how it can be. I pray you what ſynguler poynt do ye ſe in thys Nicodemus, or what other thynge do ye fynde in hym but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,

For they had laboured al nyght in vayne and had caught no fyſhe. Wherfore they now vtterly deſpayred to take any there, and therfore they were about to haue left worke. But our Sauioure Chriſte, knowynge all wythin hymſelfe, &amp; ſekynge herby occaſion, to ſhewe hys power (for tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is god wont mooſt of al to helpe, when man can do no good) entred into one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes whych pertayned to Simon, whome afterward Chriſt named Peter.

And he called hym, and ſayd vnto hym: Howe is it, that I heare this of the? Gyue acomptes of thy ſtewardſhype: For thou mayeſt be no longer ſtewarde.

                  </argument>
                  <p>GOod people, bycauſe theſe wordes before reher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed are ſo ſpoken in parable, and are ſo wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in wrinkels that yet they ſeme to haue a face of a thynge done in dede and lyke an hiſtorie: I thinke it much profytable, to tarye ſomwhat in them. And though we maye fynde in our hartes to beleue all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is here ſpoken to be true: yet I doubte whether we maye abyde that theſe wordes of Chriſte ſhulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne to vs, and admonyſh vs of our duetye, whych lyue after ſuche ſorte, as thoughe Chriſte whan he ſpake any thynge regarded not the tyme that came after hym, neyther prouided for vs, or any matters of ours, as ſome of the philoſophers thought, which ſayd, that God walketh vp and downe in heauen, &amp; thynketh neuer a deale of our doynges. But erre not you ſo, ſtycke not you to ſuch imaginations. For yf ye inwardly behold theſe wordes, yf ye diligently rolle them in youre myndes, &amp; after vnwynde them, ye ſhal ſe our tyme much touched in theſe myſteries Ye ſhall perceyue that god,<note place="margin">The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables of chriſt perteine to vs.</note> by thys exemple ſhaketh vs by the noſes, and pulleth vs by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eares. Ye ſhall perceyue very playne, that God ſetteth before oure eyes in thys ſimilitude, what we ought mooſt to flee and what we ought ſooneſt to folowe. For Luke ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth, the Lorde ſpake theſe wordes to hys diſciples.
<pb facs="tcp:173610:142"/> Wherfore let it be out of doubte, that he ſpake them to vs, whyche euen as we woll be counted Chriſtes diſciples, ſo we be, yf we be good ſtewardes and do our dutie. He ſaid theſe thynges partly to vs, and he ſpake them partly of hymſelfe. For he is that ryche man whych not only had but hath and ſhall haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore, I ſay not one but many &amp; ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry ſtewardes euen to thende of the worlde. He is man, ſeinge he is God and man. He is ryche, not only in mercy, but in all kynde of rycheſſe. For it is he, that gyueth vs all thynges abundantly. It is he, of whoſe hande we receyued both our lyues, and other thinges neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for the conſeruacion therof. What man hath any thynge I praye you, but he hath receyued it of hys plentyfulnes? To be ſhorte, it is he, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gyueth vnto vs in moſt ample wyſe hys benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, but alſo openeth hys hande, and fylleth al bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes wyth hys bleſſynge. Neyther can hys treaſure be ſpente, howe muche ſo euer he laſhe out, howe muche ſo euer we take of hym, hys treaſure taryeth ſtyll, euer taken, neuer ſpente. He is alſo the good man of the houſe. The church and congregacion is hys houſholde whych ought wyth al diligence to be fedde not only with bodily meates but alſo with his worde and hys ſacramentes. Theſe be hys goodes mooſt precious, the beſtowynge and myniſtracion herof, he wolde byſhops and curates ſhulde haue. Whych thynge ſaynt Paule affirmeth, ſayeng: Let me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſteme vs as the myniſters of Chriſt and ſtewar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of goddes myſteries.<note place="margin">ii. co. iiij</note> But I praye you what is to be loked for in a ſtewarde? Thys ſurely, that he be founde faythfull, and that he truely laye out the
<pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:173610:142"/> goodes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde, that he gyue meate in tyme, gyue it I ſay, and not ſel it: meate I ſay, and not poyſon. Fynally let hym not ſlacke and differre the doynge of hys office, but let hym do his dutie when tyme is, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nede requyreth it. Thys is alſo to be loked for, that he be one, whome God hath called and put in office, and not one that commeth vncalled, vnſent for, not one that of hymſelfe preſumeth to take ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, he muſt I ſay be a ſteward of office &amp; not a ſteward at lybertie. What is to be loked for? Surely, yf all thys y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſaye, be requyred in a good miniſter, it is much lyghter to wyſh them all in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, than to fynde one any where that hath them al. Who is a true &amp; faythfull ſteward? He is true,<note place="margin">A fayth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.</note> he is faythfull, that coyneth no new money, but taketh it redy coyned of the good man of the houſe, and nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther chaungeth it, nor clyppeth it, after it is taken to hym to ſpende, but ſpendeth euen the ſelfe ſame that he had of hys lorde, and ſpendeth it as hys lordes commaundement is, neyther to hys owne auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage vtterynge it, nor as the leude ſeruaunt dyd,<note place="margin">mat. xxv</note> hydyng it in the grounde. Now yf a faythful ſteward ought to do, as I haue ſayd, I praye you ponder thys wel, whether in chriſtendome there haue bene hytherto faythfull ſtewardes or no? I praye you was there not ſome, that deſpiſynge the money of the lorde, as copre &amp; not curraunt, eyther coyned new themſelues or els vttered abrode newlye coyned of other, ſome tyme eyther adulteratynge the worde of God, or els mynglyng it (as tauerners do,<note place="margin">☜</note> which brewe and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the euell and good both in a potte) ſometyme in the ſtede of goddes worde, blowynge out the drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
<pb facs="tcp:173610:143"/> of men: whyle they preached to the people, the redemption that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by Chriſtes death to ſerue only them that dyed before hys commyng that were in the tyme of the olde teſtament, and that nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempcion and forgyuenes of ſynnes purchaſed by money, and deuyſed of men, is of efficacy, and not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption purchaſed by Chriſt. Be theſe the faythfull ſtewardes of goddes myſteries, and not rather fals diſſipatours of them? whom god neuer put in office but rather the deuel ſette them ouer a myſerable fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>milie, ouer an houſe miſerably ordered &amp; entreated. Happy were Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome, yf ſuch preached ſeldome. And yet it is a wonder to ſe theſe, in theyr generaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be moch more prudent and politike, than the faythfull miniſters are in theyr generacion, whyle they go aboute more prudently to ſtablyſhe mennes dreames, than they do to holde vp gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Thus it cometh to paſſe that workes lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue, wylworkes, mennes fanſyes reygne, &amp; chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane workes, neceſſary workes, frutefull woorkes, be troden vnder foote. Thus the euell is moch better ſet out by euel menne, than is the good by good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe the euell be more wyſe, than be the good in theyr generacion.

I commaunded you, that wyth all induſtrie and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure ye ſhulde feade my lytle ons both bodyly with your temporall goodes and rentes whyche ye haue for that purpoſe delyuered vnto you, and alſo goſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye wyth my worde.

Wel, I wol at leſt way make me frendes of my lordes goodes, whych whan I am remoued out of myne office, ſhall take me into theyr houſes for the kyndnes and benefyte that they ſhall haue receyued at my handes.

Wherfore I declare vnto you that no man ſpeakyng by the ſpirite of God, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Ieſus. Alſo no man can ſaye that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy ghoſte.

In that we be tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned of wycked panyms into chriſtians, it is not our meryte.

It befell ſo (ſayeth Chriſt) that two certayne perſons wente vp to the temple or churche for to praye, the one was a Phariſe (that is to ſaye one that diuideth hymſelfe as better from the multi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tude &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſorte of men,<note place="margin">Origine</note> accordynge to Origenes interpretacion) the other was a publicane, that is to ſaye, a cuſtomer, a gatherer of toll or tribute, or ſuch other common officer deputed for ſuch purpoſes. The phariſe ſtandynge nye to the hygh aultare, as one that thought hymſelfe worthy to talke preſently wyth God, thus began to praye wyth himſelfe. God I thanke the, that I am not lyke to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of folke, whych lyue by rauyne, pyllage, and extorcion, which do increaſe theyr ſubſtaunce by fraude and crafte, which defyle other mens beddes wyth aduoutrye, or finally whych bearynge any ſklaunderouſe rowme or office do pyll and poll the people of God or holy church, as is thys publicane, thys tribute gatherer, thys collectour. I am not riottouſe and ſumptuous in my fare and apparell, as is the common ſorte of people, I faſt twyſe a weke, and in ſomuch defraude I noman, that alſo I diſtribute the tenth parte of my goodes vpon the poore people. Thys was the prayer of the ſwellynge and proude phariſe, whyche albeit he reapported of hymſelfe the trouth and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe thought it ynough to gyue God thankes, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſynge that he lacked nothynge, that ſhulde be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſyte vnto perfyte holynes, and therfore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed no offenſes, wheras in very dede euen in hys ſelfe prayers he ſynned mooſt greuouſlye in that he boaſted of hymſelfe and deſpyſed the penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, beynge an arrogant prayſer of hymſelfe and a raſhe accuſer of hys neyghbour.

Only acknowlegynge and confeſſynge hys naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynes, he knocketh hys breſt, condemnyng hymſelfe and humbly beggynge grace and pardon of hys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſes. My frendes, woll ye knowe the concluſion and ende of thys ſondrye and dyuerſe prayer? That ſame publicane, whych came a ſynner into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, by Chriſtes owne ſentence and determination went home in the ſyght of God more iuſt and ryghtuouſe than that phariſe, whyche thought hymſelfe mooſt ryghtuouſe.

For in very dede the hole cauſe of our ſaluation is Chriſt Ieſus, and no iote of the lawe, as the Apoſtle ſaynt Paule doth in thys epiſtle very fully and effectually proue. Yf mans teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought to be of ſuch ſtrength, that we ought nether take ought therfro, nor put ought ther to: how much rather ought gods teſtament &amp; wyl to be ſuch?

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kynde. For the promyſe or wrytyng of the teſtament was proued and confirmed by god in the only heyre Ieſu Chriſt before the law was gyuen. For the law was gyuen longe after, that is to ſaye (as Paul here wytneſſeth) aboue foure hundred and thyrty yeares after. Wherfore yf the law were any cauſe of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: then the people whych were before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law was gyuen, coulde not be iuſtifyed, whych thynge is falſe,<note place="margin">Ro xiiij</note> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle manyfeſtly proueth in hys epiſtle to the Romaynes. For Abraham was iuſtifyed lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge before the lawe came, yea and that before he was cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumciſed. It is therfore playne, that the euerlaſtyng inheritaunce can not come by the law. For yf it were by the lawe, (as reaſoneth ſaynt Paule) than it can not come by promyſe. But ſo it is, that god gaue it vnto Abraham by promyſe. Ergo the heritage of he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen and ſaluacion commeth by promyſe and not by the lawe.</p>

In dede a true and ryght chriſton man, I meane a perſon that is cleane turned into a new man &amp; whych hath ſo great fayth and charitie in hym, that for Chriſtes loue, he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do all thynges, ſuch as man nede no lawe.<note place="margin">i.

The lawe than is rather a reſtrayner from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, than a iuſtifyer, it is, as it were a brydell tyll Chriſt come and be ſetled in vs whyche maye cauſe vs to worke euen of loue wythout co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pulſion of law.

For the better vnderſtandynge wherof, ye ſhal marke, that Chriſte a lytle before the ſpeakynge of theſe wordes reioyſyng in ſpirite, gaue prayſes and thankes to hys father of heuen, bycauſe he had hyd the myſterye of the goſpell from the proude Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees whych were counted the wyſe and wyttye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones of the worlde, and had diſcloſed and opened it to ſymple and vnlerned perſons, as to fyſherme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicanes, and ſo forth, ſuch as were hys diſciples. And ſpeakynge theſe wordes, he turned hymſelfe to hys diſciples apart, and ſayde the wordes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed. Bleſſed be the eyen that ſe, whych you do ſe. For I tell you that many prophetes &amp; kynges wold haue ſene that you ſe, and ſawe not, and wolde haue herde that you heare, &amp; herde not. I praye you what herde, what ſawe theſe diſciples that the prophetes and kynges whych were before them, herde not nor ſawe not? Truly, they ſawe not, they herd not Chriſt as dyd thappoſtles.

For whan Chriſt our ſauiour was brought to the temple on the eyght daye to be circumciſed accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge to the cuſtome of the Iues, thys Symeon in ſpyred with the holy gooſt came into the temple and takynge the chylde in hys armes prayſed God and ſayd: Now thou lycenceſt me thy ſeruaunt to depart (o Lorde) accordyng to thy word in peace. For myne eyen haue ſene thy ſauynge ſtocke, whych thou haſt prepared before the face of all people. &amp;c. We reade alſo of a certayne wydowe prophetiſſe named Anne doughter of Phanuell,<note place="margin">Luce. ij.</note> which was alſo in the temple the ſame tyme, and prayſed the Lorde in lyke wyſe &amp; ſpake of thys Chriſt vnto all thoſe that wayted for the redemption of Iſraell.

<pb facs="tcp:173610:168"/> beholde, a certayne ſcribe which was a lawyer ſterte vp to take Chriſt in a trippe and to tempte hym, ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>enge: Mayſter, what ſhall I do to inherite euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynge lyfe?

Than ſayd Chriſt vnto hym: Thou haſt well anſwered. Thys do, and thou ſhalt lyue. As who ſhulde ſaye: Thou art a doctour a teacher and mayſter in Iſrael. Do the thynge that thou teacheſt other to do, be a worker of the thynge that thou readeſt.

Now good people, ye ſhall vnderſtande, that the ſcribes &amp; pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees amonges the Iues in dede taught, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſate in Moſes chaire, the lawe of God and hys com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundementes, but they added many gloſes, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretacions, and additions of theyr owne heades. They corrupted gods worde wyth theyr owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as tauerners be wont to brewe and corrupt the pure wyne wyth other vnholſome thynges for theyr owne gaynes and auauntage. And therfore whan oure ſauiour Chriſte came amonges them he went aboute to reſtore all agayne to the ryght ſence and purenes, and to ſeuer and wede out the fanſyes dreames and leuen of the phariſees wherwyth they had enſoured and corrupted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwete breade of lyfe, and he openly tolde the people, that onles theyr per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection, theyr goodnes and rightuouſnes paſſed the ryghtuouſnes and good lyuynge of the ſcribes and phariſees, they ſhulde neuer come to the kyngdome of heauen. Whervpon he went on, and taught the commaundementes of God and the pure and ryght vnderſtandynge of them as in hys mooſt excellente and ſwete ſermon whyche he made to hys diſciples on the mountayne, whych the holy Euangeliſt ſaint Matthew ſetteth forth vnto vs in the .v.vi. and .vij. chapters, more at large doth appeare.<note place="margin">Mat. vij</note> A good tree (ſayth Chriſt) bringeth forth good frute.

Thou mayeſt not ſpeake of God wyth thy mouth or praye vnto hym wyth thy lyppes, and thy harte be farre from God. Naye, thou muſt loue hym wyth thy hole harte, mynde and power, and not fayntly. And thou muſt loue thy neyghboure as thy ſelfe. Who ſoeuer doth thys, ſhall lyue. And who ſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer hath not done thys, let hym repent and become a newe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let hym aſke grace of God that he may be able through hys ayde and helpe to do it. He that ſeketh ſhall fynde, he that aſketh ſhall obtayne, to hym that knocketh, it ſhalbe opened. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge impoſſible to God. So longe as we be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and vnrenewed by the ſpirite it is not poſſible for vs to loue God wyth harte. We maye wel drede hym as a Lorde &amp; punyſher of ſynne, but loue hym as a father we can not. We maye well lyke ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes feare hym, but reuerently loue hym lyke ſonnes and doughters, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not. It is not poſſible (I ſay) for a carnall man to fulfyll the lawe whych is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.<note place="margin">Rom. vij</note> The lawe (as ye haue herde) requyreth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart. We muſt loue God wyth harte, and not drede hym for feare of punyſhment, as bondmen and bondwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do theyr lorde. Yf we woll conſyder what God hath done for vs, fyrſt he made vs of nought, he pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uydeth for vs all thynges neceſſarie to oure ſoules helth, he hath made our ſoules not as be the ſoules of beaſtes wythout reaſon and whych peryſhe &amp; dye wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, but reaſonable, but immortall, he ſente alſo hys owne ſonne from heauen to redeme man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde from the tyranny and thraldome of the deuel,
<pb n="cxlvij" facs="tcp:173610:169"/> and to teach them how to lyue a godly and an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent lyfe. Yf I ſaye we woll conſyder all thys, howe can we but loue god euen wyth harte &amp; do his ſwete wyll and pleaſure, onles we be harder then the Ada<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mant ſtones, onles we be made of ſuche a churlyſhe nature that nothynge can moue vs. But the phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees for mooſt parte were carnal and fleſhly perſons They obſerued the letter of the lawe, they kepte the outwarde wordes, they dyd no lechery outwardlye, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted no thefte, no murther, no periury nor ſuche other vyces outwardlye, they dyd ſacrifice to God, they offered vnto him, they ſenſed, they pyped, they played, they prayed after theyr faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but none of all thys was done wyth the harte. For inwardly they were full of all abhominacion, as Chriſte hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wytneſſed vnto them. For they dyd it onely for feare of punyſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and not for any harty loue that they had to God. They fulfylled the letter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe outwardly. But theyr minde, theyr ſpirite, theyr hart was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other thynges, that is to wyt, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worldly vanities and pleaſures. So they coulde not fulfyll the lawe ſo longe as they were in that caſe. For as Paule full well declareth, the lawe is ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Rom. vij.</note> and ought to be done and executed wyth the harte, wyth the ſpirite, and mynde, and not only outwardly. Yet neuertheles all the Iewes were not in thys caſe, for there were holy and iuſte perſons in all ages, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth full wel in the bokes of holy ſcripture. And there were alſo many, whych had good intentes, but they were ſo drowned wyth the blyndnes, ſuperſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gloſes, tradicions, interpretacions and dreames of the phariſees and elders that they eſpyed not the

But Chriſt perceyuynge that he was yet carnall and that he ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerued but the letter of the lawe, and not the ſpirite and mynde of the lawe, ſayd by and by vnto hym: Verely verely I ſay vnto the, onles thou be (as who ſhulde ſaye) new borne, not of thy mother, but of wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter and ſpirite, thou canſt not enter into the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of god. That that is borne of fleſh is fleſh, but that whych is borne of ſpirite is ſpirite. A fleſhly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a naturall man, a man vnbaptized, vnrenewed with the ſpirite can not ſmel nor haue any ſauour of thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges ſpirituall, he can not worke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyll and pleaſure of God. He maye well for feare ſatiſfye the outward wordes, but he ſhall neuer do the wyll of God wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly, hartely, and with ſpirite, as it is requyred of God that he ſhulde do. For as I haue ſayd, the law is ſpirituall and requyreth the harte. And ſurely it appeareth well that thys lawyer toke but the letter of the lawe &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite, by the queſtion folowyng where he aſketh Chriſt who is hys neyghboure. For yf he had loued God hertely he ſhulde haue counted euery man hys neyghboure as Chriſtes ſimilitude byddeth and not only hys owne nation as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the Iues dyd.

AS Ieſus wente to Hieruſalem he paſſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe Samaria and Galile. And as he entred in to a certayne towne, there met hym ten men that were lepers. Whych ſtode afarre of, and put forth theyr voyces and ſayd: Ieſu mayſter, haue mercye on vs. When he ſawe them, he ſayd vnto them: Go ſhewe your ſelues vnto the preſtes.
